        <p>The owner loves Big Bang Theory. She watched it for like 8 times already.</p>
        <p>Leonard Hofstadter and Sheldon Cooper are both brilliant physicists working at 
            Cal Tech in Pasadena, California. They are colleagues, best friends, and roommates, 
            although in all capacities their relationship is always tested primarily by 
            Sheldon's regimented, deeply eccentric, and non-conventional ways. 
            They are also friends with their Cal Tech colleagues mechanical engineer 
            Howard Wolowitz and astrophysicist Rajesh Koothrappali. The foursome spend their 
            time working on their individual work projects, playing video games, watching 
            science-fiction movies, or reading comic books. As they are self-professed nerds, 
            all have little or no luck with women. When Penny, a pretty woman and an aspiring 
            actress from Omaha, moves into the apartment across the hall from Leonard and 
            Sheldon's, Leonard has another aspiration in life, namely to get Penny to be his 
            girlfriend.</p>
